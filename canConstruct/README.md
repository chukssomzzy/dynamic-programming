# Problem

Write a function ' canConstruct(target, wordBank)' that accepts a target string and an array of Strings.

The function should return a true or a false depending on whether or not target can be constructed from the wordBank 

You may reuse element of word bank as many times as need

# Brute Force

m = targetString 
n = wordbank 
height = m 
branching factor = n

## Time Complexity 

O(n^m * m )

## Space Complexity 
   O(m^2)

# Memorization
