# Fibonacci
 Fibonacci sequence the first and second sequence is 1, To generate the next sequence we sum the previous two.

 fib(n)= 1, 1, 2, 3 ,5, ...
       n 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,... (n+1)

## Requirement
1. install node on your device
2. To run just type node and any .js file from cli

## Problem
write a function 'fib(n)' that takes in a number as an argument, the function should return the nth number of the fibonacci sequency


## What I Learnt From This Section
1. The leaf of the binary tree generated by the recursive fibonacci algorithm is the base case.
2.
 dynamic-programming:dynic is any instance where we have a big problem that we can decompose into smaller problems
