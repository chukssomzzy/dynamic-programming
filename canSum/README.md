# CanSum Problem

The function is of the form
canSum(targetSum,[array of value])
## Brute Force
m= targetSum 
n = array length 

### height of the root to the most distant leaf is = m 
### branching Factor = array length (does not change throw out the life time of the fn)
 ## Time Complexity
  O(n^m) time 

##Space Complexity 
O(m)Space 

## Memoization

## Time Complexity 
O(m*n)time 

## Space Complexity 
 O(m)space
