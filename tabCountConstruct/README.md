# Problem 

Write a function `countConstruct(target, wordBank)@` that acceptsa string and an array strings. 
 
 The function should return the numbers of ways the function can be constructed by the concaneting elements of the `wordBank` array.

 You may reuse elements of the `wordBank` as much as possible
